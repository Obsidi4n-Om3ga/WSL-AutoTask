# WSL-AutoTask
Automatically runs a PowerShell script after Windows Update reboot using Event ID 19 trigger.

# üß† Auto-Run WSL Check After Windows Update

Automatically run a PowerShell script after a successful **Windows Update reboot** using **Task Scheduler** and Windows Event Log monitoring.

## üéØ Goal

Run your `Check-WSL-PostUpdate-AutoReboot.ps1` script immediately after Windows completes installing an update and reboots ‚Äî without requiring any user input.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Trigger Mechanism

We utilize **Windows Event ID 19** from the `System` log, which signifies a successful Windows Update installation followed by a reboot.

### üéØ Tracked Event
| Field   | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Log     | System |
| Source  | Microsoft-Windows-WindowsUpdateClient |
| Event ID | 19 |
| Meaning | "Installation Successful" (post-update reboot) |
